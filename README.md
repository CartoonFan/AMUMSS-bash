# AMUMSS
Tool to mod No Man's Sky using lua scripts

For now, this is a repository of AMUMSS versions going forward.

Minor updates will go in the same branch when a bug correction is provided.
This will allow those of you that understand how Git works to pull the changes in no time.

For major updates, a new branch will be created that can be downloaded easily (using Code/Download ZIP) without the quarantine problems encountered elsewhere (you know!)
