# AMUMSS
Tool to mod No Man's Sky using lua scripts

IMPORTANT NOTE:
  AMUMSS uses MBINCompiler.exe AND MBINCompiler.exe REQUIRES '.NET 5 x64 Desktop Runtime' latest version to run:
  It can be found at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime
  (even if .NET 5 is technically at 'end of life', that is what is required for now and .NET 6 is NOT backward compatible with .NET 5) 

For now, this is a repository of AMUMSS versions going forward.

Minor updates will go in the same branch when a bug correction is provided.
This will allow those of you that understand how Git works to pull the changes in no time.

For major updates, a new branch will be created that can be downloaded easily (using Code/Download ZIP) without the quarantine problems encountered elsewhere (you know!)
